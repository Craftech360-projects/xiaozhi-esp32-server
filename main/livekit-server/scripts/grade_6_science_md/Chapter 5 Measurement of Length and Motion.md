Deepa, a curious eleven-year old girl, lives in a town in the state of Haryana. The new school year has started. Deepa needs a new uniform since she has grown taller. Her mother takes her to a cloth shop. She asks for a two-metre cloth piece. The shopkeeper measures the cloth using a metal measuring rod.

Then, the tailor takes her measurements using a flexible measuring tape. Her mother instructs the tailor to increase the length of her uniform by char angula (four fingers width). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.100,t=0.252,r=0.721,b=0.505), with ID 4c2e51d1-c698-4df5-ad53-23c61ccaf50c -->

### 5.1 How do we Measure?

    Hardeep says, “I have seen my grandmother measuring cloth by the length of her arm.”
    “Have you ever seen how a farmer measures length to divide his field into beds? He walks and counts the number of his strides,” says Padma.
    “Oh, not just the length of the strides—sometimes they also use the length of their feet to measure,” adds Anish.
    Deepa says excitedly, “Measuring length using body parts must be so much fun! Let us also measure something using a body part.” <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.249,t=0.391,r=0.895,b=0.636), with ID 7c24de67-1eb8-4043-ac7a-ed2517c7ed82 -->

Padma says, “Oh, the number of handspans is different for all of us. So, what can we say about the length of the table?”
    “But why should the number be different?” Hardeep asked thoughtfully.
    Tasneem says, “I can guess. Our handspans are of different sizes.” <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.117,t=0.383,r=0.750,b=0.508), with ID 947a9363-b8b3-4884-8a15-73be49b385fd -->

Anish gives an idea, “Let us check this.”
    So, all five of them put their handspans along each other and arrive at the conclusion that the lengths of their handspans are different. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.118,t=0.508,r=0.748,b=0.589), with ID 8931c031-f0da-4dda-95a4-fc071f37172e -->

Deepa says thoughtfully, “No wonder people use scales and measuring tapes.” <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.118,t=0.589,r=0.748,b=0.631), with ID 055cdf6d-e592-4a01-8a3a-d4146993a57f -->

Deepa and her friends compare the length of the table with the length of their handspans. The length of the table is expressed in terms of their handspans. Here, the handspan used for measurement is an example of a unit. And the length is expressed in two parts, a number and a unit. For example, if the length of the table is found to be 13 handspans, then 13 is the number and ‘handspan’ is the unit selected for the measurement. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.117,t=0.630,r=0.748,b=0.793), with ID 3a5166a0-48e0-4050-aa72-da04483c1a27 -->

However, handspans and other similar units, such as length of hand, foot, fist or fingers, differ from person to person. Thus, there is a need for such a unit for which measurements of the same length made by different people do not differ. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.117,t=0.793,r=0.750,b=0.896), with ID e5d90be5-0546-4829-8830-c5e97dfc5228 -->

More to know!

India has a rich history of measurement systems dating back to ancient times. Angula (finger width), multiples of angula, dhanusa, and yojana are some of the units mentioned in ancient Indian literature, and used in measuring artefacts, architecture, and town planning. The angula is still used by traditional craftspeople like carpenters and tailors. Several objects with ruled markings which could be scales have been excavated from sites of the Harappan Civilisation. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.198,t=0.108,r=0.743,b=0.368), with ID 15e7589f-924c-4523-abdd-f1d4af141ee6 -->

### 5.2 Standard Units

Several systems of units evolved with time in different parts of the world. However, when people started travelling from one place to another, it created a lot of confusion. This led to the different countries coming together and adopting a set of standard units of measurement. The system of units now used is known as the ‘International System of Units’ or SI units. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.254,t=0.427,r=0.757,b=0.650), with ID d3ffcb75-1500-4099-a66e-ef74198910b2 -->

The SI unit of length is metre. Its symbol is m. A metre scale is shown in Fig. 5.2. One metre (m) is divided into 100 equal divisions. Each division is called a centimetre (cm). You may be familiar with a smaller part of the metre scale, typically 15 cm long, shown in Fig. 5.3. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.255,t=0.650,r=0.756,b=0.794), with ID 53aa6cc9-aee4-435f-948d-315ea61ab1ac -->

Look carefully at the 15-cm scale. It has
markings (in cm) from 0 to 15. The length
of any section between two consecutive big
marks, such as between 1 and 2 or between
5 and 6, is 1 cm. Observe that these sections <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.255,t=0.793,r=0.754,b=0.898), with ID 2e9cb5f1-9b26-4d44-b7d5-52e05e1630c7 -->

of 1 cm length are further divided
into 10 equal parts. The length of
one of these smaller parts is called
a **millimetre (mm)**. 1 mm is the
smallest value of length that you
can measure using this scale. 1 mm
is equal to one-tenth of a centimeter
(1 mm = 0.1 cm). <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.117,t=0.226,r=0.512,b=0.390), with ID 78592d9a-9f4c-4ddf-b559-60fd9910b616 -->

For measuring larger lengths, we use a larger unit called a **kilometre (km)** which is equal to 1000 metres. And for measuring smaller lengths, we use units such as centimetre or millimetre. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.119,t=0.391,r=0.496,b=0.513), with ID 24ce61c2-4cb6-4154-a771-0a29a89433e2 -->

Would it be convenient to use the unit metre to measure larger lengths, such as the length of a railway track between two cities, or to measure smaller lengths, such as the thickness of a page of a book? <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.547,t=0.273,r=0.877,b=0.455), with ID 35c1210b-591d-4bb6-b24b-3bf6a3ab1c69 -->

5.3 Correct Way of Measuring Length

For measuring any length, we need an appropriate scale. For example, if you want to measure the length of your pencil, you may use a 15-cm scale. Similarly, if the height of a room is to be measured, you may need a metre scale or a measuring tape. You cannot directly measure the girth of a tree or the size of your chest using a metre scale. For such measurements, flexible measuring tape, such as a tailor’s tape is more suitable. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.253,t=0.291,r=0.889,b=0.484), with ID bb3f944e-fcf6-4cff-9cb7-005d5ff4c626 -->

While measuring lengths, we need to take care of some points. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.255,t=0.485,r=0.887,b=0.528), with ID 8407e2a2-604b-4f41-bb06-b03d0f384d10 -->

What is the correct way to place the scale?
Place the scale in contact with the object along its length as shown in Fig. 5.4. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.256,t=0.531,r=0.886,b=0.603), with ID a2829917-75de-4a3c-a2f3-9bb6ded85fdf -->

  • Both rulers are marked in centimeters (cm) and millimeters (mm), with clear numeric labels from 0 to 15.
  • The object being measured is rectangular and yellow, placed beneath the ruler in both images.
  • The background is a plain surface, and lighting is even.

Spatial Relationships :
  • In the correct method, the left edge of the object and the zero mark of the ruler coincide.
  • In the incorrect method, the left edge of the object is aligned with a point past the zero mark (approximately at 1 cm), leading to a measurement error.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually emphasizes that for accurate measurement, the zero mark of the ruler must be aligned with the starting edge of the object. Misalignment, as shown in the incorrect example, results in an overestimation of the object's length. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.106,t=0.620,r=0.892,b=0.762), with ID b4756814-7a64-405e-bde7-b4569a783ba2 -->

What is the correct position of the eye while reading the scale?

For example, if you are trying to measure the length of a pencil by aligning it with a scale, the position of your eye should be directly above the tip of the pencil (Fig. 5.5). <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.256,t=0.778,r=0.883,b=0.899), with ID 7c7f84bc-6097-4a84-a336-979c3cb0bbaa -->

Summary : This illustration demonstrates the correct position of the observer's eye when measuring the length of an object (a pencil) using a ruler, to avoid parallax error.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows a red pencil placed parallel to a transparent ruler, with the pencil tip aligned near the 15 cm mark.
  • Three eye positions are indicated above the pencil tip, labeled A, B, and C, each with a corresponding dashed line pointing to the pencil tip.
  • The correct eye position is marked as 'B', directly above the pencil tip and perpendicular to the ruler.

Technical Details :
  • The ruler is marked in centimeters from 0 to 15, with both major and minor tick marks visible.
  • The pencil is placed flush against the ruler for accurate measurement.
  • The eye positions are represented by stylized eye icons and labeled with capital letters.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Eye position B is vertically aligned with the pencil tip, ensuring a direct line of sight perpendicular to the ruler.
  • Eye positions A and C are offset to the left and right, respectively, resulting in oblique viewing angles that would cause parallax error.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually emphasizes that to obtain an accurate measurement, the observer's eye should be positioned directly above the point being measured (position B), rather than at an angle (positions A or C), to avoid misreading the scale due to parallax. <!-- figure, from page 6 (l=0.136,t=0.070,r=0.734,b=0.316), with ID 819fe6e9-b38f-47a9-9fc4-a4779384fea9 -->

How to measure the length if the ends of the scale are broken?

    If the ends of the scale are broken or the zero marking is not clear, it can still be used for measurement. With such a scale, use any other full mark of the scale, say, 1.0 cm (Fig. 5.6). Then you must subtract the reading of this mark from the reading at the other end. For example, in Fig. 5.6, the reading at one end is 1.0 cm and at the other end, it is 10.4 cm. Therefore, the length of the object is 10.4 cm–1.0 cm = 9.4 cm. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.117,t=0.325,r=0.748,b=0.544), with ID 1aa70f55-d76b-4c0d-a033-34796180ec65 -->

Summary : This image demonstrates the correct method for measuring length using a ruler with a broken end, ensuring accurate measurement despite the missing zero mark.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a transparent yellow plastic ruler placed horizontally across a rectangular yellow object (possibly a piece of paper or card).
  • The left end of the ruler is visibly broken, with the "0 cm" mark missing.
  • The ruler is aligned so that the left edge of the yellow object coincides with the "2 cm" mark on the ruler, rather than the broken end.
  • The right edge of the yellow object aligns with the "10 cm" mark on the ruler.

Technical Details :
  • The ruler displays both centimeter (cm) and millimeter (mm) markings, with numbers increasing from left to right.
  • The visible scale ranges from approximately 1 cm to 16 cm.
  • The yellow object being measured is placed under the ruler, with its left edge at the 2 cm mark and its right edge at the 10 cm mark.
  • The image is labeled as "Fig. 5.6: Correct method of placing the scale with broken end".

Spatial Relationships :
  • The yellow object is positioned so that its left edge is aligned with a known mark (2 cm) on the ruler, compensating for the missing zero.
  • The length of the object is determined by subtracting the starting mark (2 cm) from the ending mark (10 cm), yielding a length of 8 cm.

Analysis :
  • The image visually instructs that when using a ruler with a broken or missing zero end, one should align the object with a known mark (e.g., 2 cm) and measure to another mark, then subtract the starting value to obtain the correct length.
  • This method avoids errors that would result from assuming the broken end is zero. <!-- figure, from page 6 (l=0.175,t=0.548,r=0.729,b=0.734), with ID 4c61f161-a3df-4ce5-a8cc-bc1fe3b0fbeb -->

Why are some length measuring devices made up of flexible materials?

While writing the length, do not forget to write the unit also. Thus, your result will consist of two parts—one part is a number and the other part is the unit of measurement.

Some of your friends in the class would have measured the length of the same objects. Compare the lengths measured by you with that of your friends. Are the measured lengths the same or slightly different? If not the same, discuss the possible reasons for the differences. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.114,t=0.431,r=0.897,b=0.676), with ID 88ebd869-66f9-49aa-b932-486c4825dbe2 -->

Do you know?

Units of length, such as kilometre, metre, centimetre and millimetre, begin with a lowercase letter, except at the beginning of a sentence. Their symbols km, m, cm and mm are also written in lowercase letters, and are never followed by ‘s’ for the plural. Note that a full stop is not written after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the length, always leave a space between the number and the unit. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.138,t=0.690,r=0.909,b=0.898), with ID 6a2916c5-8997-4f1e-a409-75766897c228 -->

Deepa looked around her in the bus and noticed that all the passengers were seated. She looked around again after a minute and found them still occupying their seats. She wondered, ‘Are they moving?’ She concluded that the position of the passengers was not changing with time. Therefore, they were certainly at rest. However, when she looked outside, she felt they were in motion as their positions were changing with respect to things outside. <!-- text, from page 12 (l=0.123,t=0.104,r=0.763,b=0.278), with ID b0994c93-870d-460a-8d26-34cf095df55d -->

The reference point is important in deciding whether an object is at rest or in motion. If Deepa considered herself (or the bus) as the reference point, then the passengers were at rest. However, if she considered any object outside the bus (say a building) as the reference point, then the passengers (and the bus) were in motion.

When an object moves along a straight line, its motion is called **linear motion. Identify** such linear motion in your surroundings. <!-- text, from page 13 (l=0.253,t=0.081,r=0.890,b=0.150), with ID bde0db25-7d68-4259-9807-0ffcae658dc4 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates various examples of linear motion in everyday life, using four distinct scenarios: dropping an object, pushing a box, fruit falling from a tree, and a group of children marching in a line.

illustration:
# Scene Overview :
  • The figure is divided into four panels, each showing a different example of linear motion.
  • Top left: A hand drops a rectangular object vertically downward.
  • Top right: A person pushes a large box horizontally across the ground.
  • Bottom left: An orange falls straight down from a tree full of oranges.
  • Bottom right: A group of children in uniform march in a straight line along a path.

# Technical Details :
  • All panels are coloured illustrations with clear, simple backgrounds.
  • No scale bars or measurement units are present.
  • The actions depicted are all unidirectional and straight-line movements.

# Spatial Relationships :
  • Each panel visually isolates the subject and the direction of motion.
  • The dropped object, falling fruit, and marching children all move in straight paths.
  • The pushing action is shown with the person leaning forward, indicating force applied in a straight direction.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates the concept of linear motion through diverse real-world examples: vertical drop (gravity), horizontal push (applied force), and coordinated group movement (marching).
  • All motions depicted are straight-line, reinforcing the definition of linear motion.
  • The illustrations collectively highlight that linear motion can occur in both vertical and horizontal directions, and can involve objects or groups. <!-- figure, from page 13 (l=0.218,t=0.152,r=0.868,b=0.551), with ID 04353fe0-eff2-4495-816d-7f33ae737299 -->

If an object repeats its path after a fixed interval of time, its motion is said to be periodic. When an object is in circular motion, it moves along the circular path again and again. An object in oscillatory motion also repeats its motion while moving to and fro. Both circular and oscillatory motion are periodic in nature. <!-- text, from page 15 (l=0.143,t=0.542,r=0.923,b=0.704), with ID c86310bc-2a35-4839-8c29-ed4363e7d6e6 -->
