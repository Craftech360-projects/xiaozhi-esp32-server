### 6.3.1 Observe and identify appearance of materials

Materials often look different from each other. Freshly cut wood, which is unpolished, has a distinct appearance, quite different from that of iron. Similarly, iron looks different from copper or aluminium. However, there might be some similarities among iron, copper and aluminium that make them different from wood. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.256,t=0.635,r=0.887,b=0.790), with ID 04c65fe4-7366-4069-b3b1-f289454d7ea1 -->

Let us do a sorting challenge! Collect small pieces of paper, cardboard, wood, chalk, copper wire, aluminium foil and any article made up of brass, bronze, steel, etc. Take a look at the pieces you have collected. Do any of these materials shine when light falls on them? Observe their texture (whether <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.257,t=0.790,r=0.888,b=0.893), with ID 822bbd23-3656-4294-b001-cd5344f4036e -->

Summary : This image shows a green circular badge with the number "106" in white text, surrounded by a lighter green irregular border.

logo:
  Main Elements :
    • Central number: "106" in bold white font.
    • Background: Solid green circle.
    • Border: Irregular, hand-drawn style, light green outline.
  Dimensions & Placement :
    • Circular shape, approximately equal width and height.
    • Number centered within the circle.
  Colour Palette :
    • Green (main circle), light green (border), white (text).

Analysis :
  • The badge design is simple and uses green to possibly indicate a positive or "go" status, with the number "106" as the focal point. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.071,t=0.877,r=0.133,b=0.921), with ID 1db38417-b0d4-41da-9fef-57cd168b6621 -->

Materials that typically have shiny surfaces are said to have a lustrous appearance. Such materials with lustre are usually metals. Examples of metals include iron, copper, zinc, aluminium, gold, etc. However, some metals may lose their lustre and start to look dull or non-lustrous due to the effect of air and moisture on them. As a result, we often notice the lustre only on their freshly cut surfaces. **Non-lustrous** materials are those that do not have a shiny surface. Some examples of non-lustrous materials are paper, wood, rubber, jute, etc.

Are all lustrous materials metals? <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.116,t=0.145,r=0.792,b=0.363), with ID 855fd3d3-7573-4396-8c25-c4abda18524b -->

“All that glitters is not gold” goes an old saying! Not all the materials that shine are metals. Surfaces of some materials are made shiny by polishing or coating them with thin layers of plastic, wax or any other material which makes them look shiny. These materials may not be metals.

### 6.3.2 Which materials are hard?

When you press different objects or materials with your hands, some of them like stones, may be hard to compress, while others, like an eraser, can be easily compressed. Take a metal key and use it to scratch the surface of a piece of wood, aluminium, stone, iron, candle, chalk and any other material or object. Can some materials be scratched more easily than others? Materials which can be compressed or scratched easily are **soft**, while other materials which are difficult to compress or scratch are **hard**. However, these properties are relative in nature. For example, rubber is harder than sponge but softer than iron. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.116,t=0.501,r=0.750,b=0.759), with ID e417c163-af31-4028-bd17-2166554df36e -->

You might have noticed that some materials completely disappear when mixed in water. We say that these materials dissolve in water or, in other words, they are **soluble** in water (Fig. 6.6a). Some materials do not mix with water and do not disappear even after we stir them for a long time. These materials are **insoluble** in water (Fig. 6.6b). Water plays an important role in the functioning of our body because it can dissolve a large number of materials.

Does everything you put in water disappear? <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.114,t=0.458,r=0.853,b=0.688), with ID e61dcdc9-581a-4313-bb8b-2f26ffa44508 -->

Summary : This figure compares the appearance of water when a soluble material is added versus when an insoluble material is added, illustrating the difference between dissolution and suspension.

Now you have become familiar with many properties
of materials. However, all
materials do not possess all
these properties.

Are there any <!-- text, from page 14 (l=0.112,t=0.079,r=0.768,b=0.168), with ID 101bfa30-b2a5-4412-a646-cd81706967d8 -->

6.4 What is Matter?

Mass and volume are the two properties that are possessed by all materials. Can we give a general name to anything that possesses these two properties?

Are there any properties which can be shown by all materials? If yes, what are those?
? <!-- text, from page 14 (l=0.120,t=0.143,r=0.774,b=0.318), with ID 3e76b6d3-bbab-4e1d-be72-216511c60d64 -->

Anything that occupies space and has
mass is called **matter**. The mass gives the quantity of matter,
and the units to measure it are gram (g) and kilogram (kg).
The space occupied by matter is its volume. The units to
measure the volume are litre (L) and millilitre (mL). <!-- text, from page 14 (l=0.119,t=0.318,r=0.747,b=0.420), with ID 8861c1a7-75cb-4324-9ce2-58bf8920b333 -->

Kilogram is the unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI). Kilogram is abbreviated in lower case as kg. There is no space between ‘k’ and ‘g’ in kg, and no full stop after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the mass, always leave a space between the number (numerical value) and the unit. For example, if we have mass of 7 kilograms, it would be written as 7 kg and not as 7 kgs. <!-- text, from page 14 (l=0.122,t=0.467,r=0.724,b=0.632), with ID 90083fce-65ff-4f81-ae4f-113889675ec3 -->

Similarly, litre is abbreviated as capital L and millilitre as mL. There is no space between ‘m’ and ‘L’ in mL. For example, if you have 500 millilitres of water, it would be written as 500 mL, m will be in lower case and L will be in upper case. The SI unit for volume is cubic metre, abbreviated as m³. The abbreviation is written with a superscript 3 to denote cubic metre. For example, if you have volume of 2 cubic metres, it would be written as 2 m³. Always leave a space between number (numerical value) and the unit. 1 m³ = 1000 L.

We find grouping useful as it helps us study and observe patterns in the properties of things. Humans have been classifying not only things, but also rocks, plants and animals. We have learnt about the classification of the living world in the chapter ‘Diversity in the Living World’. Just like in the living world, classification of the non-living world is also done on the basis of their properties. <!-- text, from page 15 (l=0.255,t=0.309,r=0.887,b=0.454), with ID 81eea45d-fcef-43aa-9c54-b5ecb1ff6221 -->

- ◆ Objects are made from a large variety of materials. An object can be made up of a single material or a combination of different materials.
- ◆ We can use different materials to make objects with similar functions.
- ◆ The method of arranging objects into groups is called classification.
- ◆ Materials possess different properties which determine their use.
- ◆ Materials are grouped or classified based on their similarities or differences in their properties.
- ◆ Materials can be grouped based on appearance, such as lustrous or non-lustrous and based on the feel, such as hard or soft.
- ◆ Materials are grouped as transparent, translucent or opaque depending on how much we can see through them.
- ◆ Some materials are soluble in water, while others remain insoluble.
- ◆ Anything that occupies space and has mass is called matter.
- ◆ The space occupied by matter is its volume.
- ◆ Mass quantifies the amount of matter present in an object. <!-- text, from page 17 (l=0.251,t=0.081,r=0.895,b=0.590), with ID 28331375-703f-4153-9a19-ce33f01de900 -->
