The magnets used by sailors in the olden days were based on naturally occurring magnets, known as lodestones which were discovered in ancient times. Later on, people found out that magnets could also be made from pieces of iron. Nowadays, we have magnets made of different materials. The magnets that you find in your school laboratory and those used in pencil boxes, stickers, toys are all artificial magnets (Fig. 4.1). The magnets can be of various shapes, some of which are shown in Fig. 4.2. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.252,t=0.211,r=0.890,b=0.402), with ID 07b34b0f-e7d9-4371-9e55-e9a34ecba0ac -->

Was your prediction correct for all objects? Which materials stuck to the magnet? What conclusion can you draw? <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.254,t=0.081,r=0.889,b=0.144), with ID 4054193c-0c29-4a0e-a561-28fa51ddd793 -->

Do all parts of a magnet attract magnetic materials equally?

Through this activity, we found out that some of the objects were attracted to the magnet and stuck to it, while others were not. The materials which are attracted towards a magnet are called **magnetic materials**. The metal iron is a magnetic material. Nickel and cobalt are other metals that are also magnetic. Some of their combinations with other metals are also attracted towards magnets. The materials which are not attracted towards a magnet are called **non-magnetic materials**.

Which materials listed in Table 4.1 were found to be non-magnetic? <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.139,t=0.143,r=0.889,b=0.409), with ID 3bdd9637-18c7-47cc-8255-0d9a1e224268 -->

- ◆ Spread some iron filings (very small pieces of iron) on a sheet of paper.
- ◆ Place a bar magnet over them. Tap the paper and observe carefully what happens to the iron filings. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.258,t=0.469,r=0.888,b=0.586), with ID 295263be-a46e-4d70-8bb0-97b9bc8e42ef -->

Do you observe anything special about the way they stick to the magnet? Do the iron filings stick all over the magnet uniformly? Or do the iron filings stick more at some places?
    We find that maximum iron filings stick near the ends of the bar magnet, as shown in Fig. 4.4, while a very few iron filings stick at the remaining part of the magnet. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.256,t=0.589,r=0.887,b=0.714), with ID 79e7b415-b9ab-43e3-9065-64bffd34a6b7 -->

Summary : This photograph shows a bar magnet with iron filings visibly adhering to its surface, illustrating the distribution of magnetic field strength around the magnet.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a red bar magnet placed horizontally.
  • The magnet is labeled with "S" (left end) and "N" (right end), indicating the south and north poles respectively.
  • Iron filings are densely clustered at both ends (poles) of the magnet, forming bushy, radiating patterns.
  • Fewer filings are present along the central region of the magnet.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or magnification is provided.
  • The image is well-lit, with clear contrast between the red magnet and the dark iron filings.
  • The photograph is taken from a top-down perspective, showing the entire magnet and the distribution of filings.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Iron filings are most concentrated at the poles (ends labeled "S" and "N").
  • The central region of the magnet has sparse or minimal filings.
  • The filings at the poles radiate outward, visually emphasizing the magnetic field lines.

Analysis :
  • The clustering of iron filings at the poles demonstrates that the magnetic field is strongest at the ends of the bar magnet.
  • The sparse filings in the middle indicate weaker magnetic field strength along the sides.
  • The pattern of filings provides a visual representation of the invisible magnetic field lines, with maximum density at the poles and minimum at the center. <!-- figure, from page 3 (l=0.213,t=0.734,r=0.527,b=0.887), with ID 11e33b01-be31-4bab-b201-429be4cf8919 -->

These ends of the magnet are called the two poles of the magnet—the North pole and the South pole. Most of the iron filings stick to the poles of a magnet of any shape.
    It is not possible to obtain a magnet with a single pole. If a magnet is broken into smaller pieces, North and South poles always exist in pairs even in the smallest piece of the magnet. A single North pole or a South pole cannot exist.

Can we find a magnet with a single pole? <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.111,t=0.081,r=0.850,b=0.274), with ID 43c2d964-c00e-4b92-aac7-e106b6b1666e -->

## 4.3 Finding Directions

**Activity 4.3: Let us experiment**

- ◆ Suspend a bar magnet with a thread tied to the middle of the magnet as shown in Fig. 4.5. You may need to adjust the position of the string till the magnet is balanced horizontally.
- ◆ Now rotate the magnet gently in the horizontal direction and let it come to rest.
- ◆ Mark the position corresponding to the ends of the magnet on the ground (or on a piece of paper stuck to the ground). Join these two points on the ground with a line. This line indicates the direction along which the magnet comes to rest.
- ◆ Now again rotate the magnet by giving a gentle push at its one end and wait till it comes to rest. Does the magnet rest along the same line?

A freely suspended magnet comes to rest along the north-south direction. The end of the magnet that points towards north direction is called the North-seeking pole or the **North pole of the magnet**. The other end that points towards the South direction is called the South-seeking pole or the **South pole of the magnet**. A freely suspended magnet rests along the north-south direction because our Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.254,t=0.084,r=0.889,b=0.249), with ID 567cd6bb-ce85-4103-b111-2d502dda0124 -->

Repeat this activity with a small iron bar in place of the bar magnet. What do you observe? Does it always rest along north-south direction? It does not. It can rest along any direction. This implies that only magnets rest along north-south direction. This activity provides us with a way to test whether a piece of metal is a magnet or not. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.256,t=0.250,r=0.888,b=0.372), with ID eaea4819-9648-4ce9-b58b-7c95a18e9568 -->

The property of a freely suspended magnet to always rest along the north-south direction is used to find directions. Based on this, a small device called a magnetic compass was developed in olden days for finding directions. It has a magnet in the shape of a needle which can rotate freely (Fig. 4.6). The needle of a magnetic compass indicates the north-south direction. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.259,t=0.373,r=0.887,b=0.515), with ID cbd54ea9-a3fa-42fc-bc7e-16ee7006a765 -->

  • The compass rose features a red star design for visual emphasis.  
  • The needle is metallic, with the north-pointing end typically marked or coloured (not specified in this image).

Spatial Relationships :  
  • The compass needle is aligned such that the north end points toward the top of the image, and the south end toward the bottom right.  
  • The compass is centered, with degree and direction labels evenly distributed around the perimeter.

Analysis :  
  • The image clearly illustrates the function and design of a magnetic compass, showing how the needle aligns with Earth's magnetic field to indicate north.  
  • The degree markings allow for precise measurement of direction, useful in navigation.  
  • The visual emphasis on cardinal directions and the needle's alignment reinforce the compass's role in orientation. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.098,t=0.437,r=0.365,b=0.675), with ID 78cc2dd6-4b9e-4375-8931-7e66dde1da7e -->

The compass is kept at the place where we wish to know the directions. After some time, the needle comes to rest in the north-south direction. The compass box is then gently rotated until the north and south marked on the dial are aligned with the needle. Now all directions at that place are as indicated on the dial. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.366,t=0.514,r=0.887,b=0.658), with ID 438a3ba9-6c84-44fc-8da7-1571acee33bb -->

Summary : This figure demonstrates the interaction between two bar magnets, showing their relative positions and the resulting behavior when their poles are brought close together.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The figure consists of two panels, labeled (a) and (b), each showing two red bar magnets labeled Magnet A and Magnet B.
  • Magnet A is placed horizontally atop a set of colored pencils, with its North (N) pole on the left and South (S) pole on the right.
  • Magnet B is held vertically by a hand below Magnet A, with its North (N) pole at the top and South (S) pole at the bottom.
  • Panel (a): Magnet B is oriented with its North pole facing the North pole of Magnet A.
  • Panel (b): Magnet B is oriented with its South pole facing the North pole of Magnet A.

Technical Details :
  • Both magnets are clearly labeled with "N" and "S" at their respective ends.
  • The colored pencils serve as a support for Magnet A, ensuring it remains horizontal.
  • The hand holding Magnet B is visible in both panels, indicating manual movement or positioning.

Spatial Relationships :
  • In both panels, Magnet B is positioned directly below Magnet A, aligned vertically.
  • The relative orientation of the poles is the key variable between the two panels: (a) shows like poles (N-N) facing each other, (b) shows opposite poles (N-S) facing each other.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually sets up a comparison between the interaction of like poles (N-N) and opposite poles (N-S) of two bar magnets.
  • This arrangement is likely intended to demonstrate magnetic repulsion in (a) and magnetic attraction in (b), based on the orientation of the poles.
  • The use of colored pencils and clear labeling aids in distinguishing the magnets and their poles for educational purposes. <!-- figure, from page 7 (l=0.268,t=0.434,r=0.881,b=0.790), with ID 676f68ca-e273-4277-9f7d-c1c2df218d61 -->

You will see that unlike poles of two magnets, that is, the North pole of one magnet and the South pole of another magnet, attract each other. The like poles, that is, either the North poles or the South poles of both magnets, repel each other. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.254,t=0.796,r=0.890,b=0.906), with ID af08d086-7c25-487b-9c1a-5e1dfea274b0 -->

the deflection of the needle when a sheet of any of the above
material is placed between the magnet and the compass
needle. Therefore, we can **conclude** that the magnetic effect
can act through non-magnetic materials. <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.115,t=0.360,r=0.749,b=0.468), with ID 07dc0ca2-5f6d-486e-a045-2580f0dd04a7 -->

4.5 Fun with Magnets

After learning about magnets, Reshma was excited and decided to set up some fun activities using magnets at her school fair. You may try making these yourself and may also think of some more fun ideas.
    Can we make a garland? (Fig. 4.11) <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.116,t=0.475,r=0.750,b=0.618), with ID 691d84ce-2563-4c35-a1ab-34e7474fc22a -->

Summary : This photograph demonstrates the phenomenon of magnetic attraction by showing a bar magnet lifting a chain of metallic pins, forming a "magnetic garland".

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a human hand holding a red bar magnet horizontally by its center.
  • The bar magnet is labeled with "S" (south) on the left end and "N" (north) on the right end.
  • A cluster of metallic pins (likely iron or steel) is attached to the underside of the magnet, forming a hanging chain or garland shape due to magnetic attraction.
  • The background is plain and uncluttered, focusing attention on the hand, magnet, and pins.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement is present.
  • The magnet is a standard rectangular bar type, painted red with white pole markings.
  • The pins are gold-colored and appear to be standard drawing pins or thumbtacks.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The hand is positioned above the magnet, with fingers pinching the center.
  • The pins hang downward from both poles of the magnet, forming a U-shaped garland.
  • The "S" and "N" poles are clearly visible, with pins clustering at both ends.

Analysis :
  • The image visually demonstrates the magnetic field's ability to attract and hold ferromagnetic objects (pins) at both poles of the magnet.
  • The formation of a "garland" shows that the magnetic force is strongest at the poles, where the pins cluster and hang.
  • This setup is commonly used in educational contexts to illustrate magnetic attraction and the distribution of magnetic force. <!-- figure, from page 10 (l=0.143,t=0.626,r=0.393,b=0.870), with ID 92e01cef-bdd4-4682-9e48-13614dc31794 -->

Summary : This figure demonstrates two experiments using magnets to manipulate steel objects: (1) guiding steel balls through a maze by moving a magnet below a cardboard tray, and (2) retrieving a steel paperclip from a glass of water using a magnet without getting fingers or the magnet wet.

photo:
# Scene Overview :
  • Left panel: A cardboard tray with a maze made of pink barriers and several steel balls placed at different locations within the maze.
  • Right panel: A hand holding a magnet above a glass of water, with a steel paperclip attached to the magnet and being lifted out of the water.
  • Both images illustrate the use of magnets to move or retrieve steel objects without direct contact.

# Technical Details :
  • The maze is constructed from straight pink rods arranged on a black background, with steel balls visible at various points.
  • The glass of water is clear, and the steel paperclip is visibly attracted to the magnet, which is held by a hand above the water.
  • No scale bars or measurement units are present.
  • Captions below the images: "Fig. 4.12: Steel balls in a maze" and "Fig. 4.13: Steel paperclip in water".

# Spatial Relationships :
  • In the maze, steel balls are distributed at different locations, suggesting they can be moved through the maze by an external force.
  • In the water experiment, the magnet is positioned above the water surface, successfully lifting the paperclip without submerging the magnet or fingers.

# Analysis :
  • The figure visually confirms that magnets can be used to move steel balls through a maze from below a tray and to retrieve steel objects from water without direct contact, demonstrating the practical effects of magnetic attraction on steel objects in different scenarios. <!-- figure, from page 11 (l=0.248,t=0.084,r=0.894,b=0.507), with ID 5dcc568f-abef-4b29-90d8-05a26cd0d3c6 -->

Summary : This figure shows two matchbox cars, each with a magnet attached, positioned so that the like poles of the magnets face each other. The setup is used to illustrate the interaction between like magnetic poles.

Summary : This figure contains two illustrations related to magnets. The first (Fig. 4.16) shows two ring magnets (X and Y) placed on a vertical rod, with X floating above Y. The second (Fig. 4.17) shows three bar magnets arranged in a bent (L-shaped) configuration, with six labeled ends (1–6), and the polarity of end 5 marked as 'N'.

illustration:
# Fig. 4.16: Two ring magnets
Scene Overview :
  • Two ring-shaped magnets labeled X (top) and Y (bottom) are placed on a vertical cylindrical rod.
  • Magnet X is suspended above magnet Y, not touching it.
  • The rod is wooden or non-magnetic, serving as a support.
Technical Details :
  • Both magnets are identical in appearance and size.
  • The vertical arrangement suggests magnetic repulsion between X and Y.
Spatial Relationships :
  • Magnet X is floating above Y, indicating like poles are facing each other (repulsion).
  • The rod passes through the center holes of both ring magnets.

# Fig. 4.17: Three bar magnets
Scene Overview :
  • Three bar magnets are arranged in an L-shape (right angle) on a flat surface.
  • The ends of the magnets are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in sequence around the shape.
  • End 5 is explicitly marked as 'N' (North pole).
Technical Details :
  • The magnets are rectangular and of similar size.
  • The arrangement forms a continuous path, with each magnet touching the next at the labeled ends.
Spatial Relationships :
  • The sequence of ends is: 1 (outer corner), 2 (inner corner), 3 (outer corner), 4 (inner corner), 5 (outer corner, marked N), 6 (outer corner).
  • The L-shape suggests the magnets are joined at right angles.

Analysis :
  • In Fig. 4.16, the floating of magnet X above Y indicates that the facing surfaces of X and Y have like poles (both North or both South), causing repulsion.
  • In Fig. 4.17, the given polarity at end 5 (N) allows deduction of the polarities at other ends by following the rule that opposite poles attract and like poles repel. The arrangement is designed to test understanding of magnetic polarity continuity in composite shapes. <!-- figure, from page 15 (l=0.209,t=0.081,r=0.909,b=0.627), with ID 81b71ddc-2165-4a2f-8cf0-b25102781800 -->

Summary : This figure shows a simple paper model called "My hopping frog," demonstrating how a paper frog can be made to jump using a folded strip and a ruler.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The left panel (a) displays a paper strip with a cartoon frog attached at the top, and a transparent ruler with black circles beside it.
  • The right panel (b) shows the same frog and strip, but now the strip is compressed and held at the bottom by a hand, with the ruler placed behind the strip and frog.
  • The frog is yellow with orange toes, viewed from the back.
  • The background is plain white, and the lighting is even.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or measurement units are visible, but the ruler provides an implicit scale.
  • The frog is made of paper or card, and the strip appears to be folded or pleated paper.
  • The ruler is transparent with black circular markings.

Spatial Relationships :
  • In (a), the frog and strip are upright and uncompressed.
  • In (b), the frog and strip are aligned with the ruler, and the strip is compressed by a hand at the bottom, suggesting a mechanism for making the frog "hop" when released.
  • The frog is always at the top of the strip, and the ruler is used as a guide or support.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually explains a hands-on activity where compressing and releasing a folded paper strip can make a paper frog "hop" upwards, likely as a demonstration of stored elastic energy and motion.
  • The use of a ruler provides a straight guide for the frog's movement.
  • The sequence from (a) to (b) shows the setup and the action required to make the frog jump. <!-- figure, from page 16 (l=0.167,t=0.218,r=0.731,b=0.628), with ID 0837925e-d994-4e7c-8c58-cc19eb22cc69 -->

Summary : This figure illustrates five different shapes of magnets—bar, disc, cylindrical, ring, and spherical—showing their physical forms and the arrangement of their north (N) and south (S) poles.

illustration:
# Magnet Types and Pole Arrangements :

• The figure is organized into five columns, each representing a different magnet shape: Bar Magnet, Disc Magnet, Cylindrical Magnet, Ring Magnet, and Spherical Magnet.
• Each column contains labeled diagrams of the magnet shape, with red and blue coloring to indicate the north (N) and south (S) poles.
• The north (N) and south (S) poles are clearly marked on each magnet, showing their spatial orientation.

## Bar Magnet :
• Rectangular prism shape.
• N and S poles at opposite ends (lengthwise).
• Two views: side and top.

## Disc Magnet :
• Flat, circular disc shape.
• N and S poles on the flat faces (top and bottom).
• Two views: top and side.

## Cylindrical Magnet :
• Solid cylinder shape.
• N and S poles on the flat circular ends.
• Two views: vertical and horizontal orientation.

## Ring Magnet :
• Hollow, circular ring (torus) shape.
• N and S poles can be on the flat faces or along the circumference, as shown in three different arrangements.

## Spherical Magnet :
• Sphere shape.
• N and S poles on opposite hemispheres.

# Analysis :
• The figure demonstrates that magnets can be manufactured in various shapes, each with a distinct arrangement of north and south poles.
• The pole orientation depends on the magnet's geometry, with the poles always located at the ends or faces farthest apart.
• The ring magnet is shown with multiple possible pole arrangements, highlighting the flexibility in magnetization direction for this shape. <!-- figure, from page 17 (l=0.105,t=0.264,r=0.900,b=0.566), with ID 84bfe8c2-9223-4e28-a35e-5b4f104a8174 -->
