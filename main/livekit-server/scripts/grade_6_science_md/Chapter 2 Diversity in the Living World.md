## 2.2  How to Group Plants and Animals?

How would you arrange your books and notebooks in groups? Would arranging them in groups help you better organise your school bag?
    Now, let us look at the world around us. We are surrounded by a variety of plants and animals with different features about which you have learnt in section 2.1. We can group them based on similarities and differences among them. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.252,t=0.221,r=0.888,b=0.419), with ID 607c9e4e-265c-4b8a-996e-323843979c32 -->

- ◆ Collect pictures of various other plants and animals. Cut their pictures from old magazines, newspapers, charts and other sources. Paste each of these pictures on a different card.
- ◆ Divide your class in groups of 5–6 students each.
- ◆ Pool the cards prepared by the students in your group.
- ◆ Observe various features of plants and animals shown on the cards.
- ◆ Recall the features of plants and animals that you have listed in Tables 2.1 and 2.2.
- ◆ **Group** them on the basis of common features.
- ◆ Share and discuss the basis of grouping you have made with other groups in your class. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.256,t=0.421,r=0.998,b=0.750), with ID 9e4e702a-4ced-4282-9040-1275a3d8fc27 -->

You will be surprised to see that the basis used by different groups may vary. What do you think are the reasons behind it? Different students might have chosen different common features for the grouping. For example, some students may have chosen the height of plants as the basis for grouping while others might have chosen presence or absence of flowers as the basis for grouping of plants (See Fig. 2.2). <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.252,t=0.749,r=0.905,b=0.895), with ID 188fc684-8830-4a37-8f2b-bb831af77022 -->

### 2.2.1 How to group plants?

You must have noticed that plants show variation in the features related to stems, leaves, flowers, and more. The stems of different plants vary in thickness, height, and hardness, while the leaves vary in shape, colour, size and arrangement. You might have tried grouping the plants in Activity 2.3 using one of these features. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.116,t=0.366,r=0.746,b=0.518), with ID 0a6c26b2-5e1a-4082-b7d0-b695606e9851 -->

You might have also learnt in earlier classes that plants can be grouped into herbs, shrubs, and trees based on their height and types of stem. Let us study the features of plants in more detail and group them on that basis. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.117,t=0.518,r=0.745,b=0.599), with ID d8027375-adbf-4049-903c-f0b31e428655 -->

- ◆ Let us go on a nature walk again for some more interesting observations.
- ◆ Look closely at the height of different plants. Are these plants shorter than you, as tall as you, or taller than you?
- ◆ Is the stem brown or green? Touch and feel the stems and try to bend them gently. Can you bend the stem easily, or is it stiff? Take care that the stems do not break.
- ◆ Also, observe from where the branches of the plants arise—whether they arise close to the ground or higher up on the stem. Fill in your observations in Table 2.3. A few examples are already given. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.121,t=0.607,r=0.909,b=0.894), with ID 8a2d596d-6140-4489-9bf5-f91049db50b3 -->

Some plants are not as tall as trees. These plants often have many brown woody stems that start branching very close to the ground. These stems are hard but not as thick as the stem of a tree. These plants are called **shrubs**. For example, a rose plant is a shrub (Fig. 2.3b). <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.117,t=0.086,r=0.746,b=0.186), with ID a8ab92c1-9756-48e5-a401-5dcce7ad1df7 -->

Some plants are typically small with soft and green stems. These are known as herbs. For example, a tomato plant is a herb (Fig. 2.3c). <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.118,t=0.186,r=0.744,b=0.245), with ID 1375cf21-7223-4b07-b995-84cdf31b4f68 -->

Some plants with weak stems need support to climb and grow, and are called **climbers**. Some plants creep along the ground and are called **creepers**. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.119,t=0.245,r=0.744,b=0.304), with ID ca87660e-5a4d-4571-821c-f436c40586ab -->

You may observe thin lines on the leaves of the plants (Fig. 2.4a). These are **veins**. The pattern of veins on the leaf is called **venation**. What differences do you see in the veins of leaves shown in Fig. 2.4a and Fig. 2.4b? <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.117,t=0.471,r=0.746,b=0.556), with ID 01f57bcd-b3a8-447b-b3f5-b9a647d509b5 -->

Summary : This illustration compares two types of leaf venation patterns using examples from hibiscus and banana plants.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The image shows two leaves side by side: a hibiscus leaf on the left and a banana leaf on the right.
  • The hibiscus leaf is green, ovate, and displays a network of veins forming a reticulate (net-like) pattern.
  • The banana leaf is elongated, green, and exhibits parallel venation, with veins running lengthwise from base to tip.
  • Each leaf is labeled with its name and venation type: (a) Hibiscus leaf with reticulate venation, (b) Banana leaf with parallel venation.

Technical Details :
  • The illustration uses realistic colours and shading to highlight vein patterns.
  • No scale bar or magnification is present.
  • Labels are placed below each leaf for identification.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The hibiscus leaf is positioned on the left, banana leaf on the right.
  • Both leaves are oriented with their petioles pointing downward and to the left.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually contrasts reticulate venation (networked veins) typical of dicot plants (hibiscus) with parallel venation (straight, parallel veins) typical of monocot plants (banana).
  • The clear depiction aids in distinguishing between the two major types of leaf venation in flowering plants. <!-- figure, from page 8 (l=0.123,t=0.573,r=0.578,b=0.716), with ID b9dfe7ea-be28-4b29-9f58-7f1955938149 -->

Summary : This illustration shows a grass leaf exhibiting parallel venation, a characteristic pattern of leaf veins.

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Main subject is a single elongated green grass leaf.
  • The leaf is depicted with multiple veins running parallel from base to tip.
  • The perspective is lateral, showing the full length and curvature of the leaf.
  • Colour palette consists of various shades of green.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or magnification indicated.
  • No additional text or UI elements on the image itself.
  • Caption below reads: “(c) Grass leaf with parallel venation”.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The veins are evenly spaced and run parallel along the length of the leaf.
  • The leaf curves gently, with the base thicker and the tip tapering to a point.

Analysis :
  • The illustration visually communicates the concept of parallel venation, typical of monocot plants such as grasses, where veins do not intersect but run side by side from base to tip. <!-- figure, from page 8 (l=0.592,t=0.572,r=0.751,b=0.716), with ID 05f91a6e-2e8a-4f9c-b73b-f3570e0d987e -->

Fig. 2.4: *Leaves showing different types of venation*

    In some leaves, you can observe a net-like pattern of veins on both sides of a thick middle vein. This pattern is called **reticulate venation**. For example, leaves of hibiscus exhibit reticulate venation (Fig. 2.4a). In some leaves, you may observe that the veins run parallel. This pattern is called **parallel venation**. For example, the leaves of banana plants and grasses exhibit parallel venation (Fig. 2.4b and Fig. 2.4c). <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.119,t=0.721,r=0.746,b=0.886), with ID 4fd2962e-0f71-489d-b689-990288c4b620 -->

Do you observe any relation between the leaf venation and types of root in these plants? A sadabahar plant has a taproot and its leaves have reticulate venation. Do other plants with reticulate venation have taproots too? Lemongrass, on the other hand, has fibrous roots and its leaves have parallel venation. Do other plants with parallel venation have fibrous roots too? Generally, plants with reticulate venation have taproots while those with parallel venation have fibrous roots. <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.115,t=0.658,r=0.746,b=0.837), with ID 1120a3dc-fa9f-4f37-aa48-57cd032a8207 -->

Summary : This figure compares the internal structure of dicot and monocot seeds, specifically chickpea (dicot) and maize (monocot), highlighting the number and arrangement of cotyledons.

illustration:
# Dicot Seed (Chickpea) :
  • Depicted as a split seed showing two large, oval cotyledons.
  • Cotyledons are labelled with arrows.
  • A small embryonic shoot (plumule) and root (radicle) are visible between the cotyledons.
  • Seed coat is shown as a thin outer layer.

# Monocot Seed (Maize) :
  • Depicted as a single, intact seed with one cotyledon.
  • Cotyledon is not separately labelled but is visible as a lighter internal structure.
  • Embryonic plant is shown within the seed, surrounded by endosperm.
  • Seed coat is shown as a thicker, golden outer layer.

# Scene Overview :
  • Both seeds are illustrated in cross-section to reveal internal anatomy.
  • The dicot seed is split open, while the monocot seed is shown whole.
  • Colour palette uses yellow/orange for seed bodies and green for embryonic shoot.

# Technical Details :
  • No scale bar or magnification indicated.
  • Labels: “Cotyledons” (with arrows), “Dicot seed (chickpea)”, “Monocot seed (maize)”, and figure number “Fig. 2.6: Dicot and monocot seeds”.

# Spatial Relationships :
  • Dicot seed is on the left, monocot seed on the right.
  • Cotyledons are the most prominent structures in the dicot seed; monocot seed has a single cotyledon surrounded by endosperm.

# Analysis :
  • The figure visually demonstrates the key difference between dicot and monocot seeds: dicots have two cotyledons, while monocots have one.
  • The internal arrangement and relative size of cotyledons are clearly contrasted.
  • The illustration supports identification and understanding of seed types based on cotyledon number and structure. <!-- figure, from page 11 (l=0.263,t=0.274,r=0.868,b=0.475), with ID 7e0af446-d7aa-49ec-8103-b2bb744bac52 -->

You would notice that chickpea seeds are split into two parts (Fig. 2.6a). Each part is called a cotyledon. Plants that have seeds with two cotyledons are called dicotyledons (dicots). Maize has a single thin cotyledon (Fig. 2.6b). Plants with such seeds are called monocotyledons (monocots). <!-- text, from page 11 (l=0.257,t=0.477,r=0.878,b=0.577), with ID f60398d4-5207-406d-b323-e319edbd2ef8 -->

What relation do you observe among leaf venation, root types and the number of cotyledons in seeds of a plant?  
Dicot plants have reticulate venation and a taproot system while monocot plants have parallel venation and a fibrous root system. <!-- text, from page 11 (l=0.258,t=0.577,r=0.879,b=0.673), with ID a4bdea18-e58f-46d5-8f22-4b44059e353f -->

What conclusions can you draw from the data given in Table 2.5?
    Different animals have different types of movement. Animals can fly, run, crawl, walk, hop or jump, and so on. They use different body parts for moving from one place to another. They may use wings, legs, and other parts that help them to move. Here, we have identified animals based on the types of movement and the body parts used for movement. How can we group animals based on their movements? Additionally, many animals differ from each other in shape, size, structure, colour, and other features. Some of these features can also be used to group animals in various ways. Like plants, grouping of animals is important for understanding their diversity. <!-- text, from page 13 (l=0.254,t=0.403,r=0.884,b=0.683), with ID ca3b6894-b217-455e-8003-90be01187fea -->

**Success Story—Save Silent Valley Movement**

This is a real story of a forest in the Palakkad district of Kerala. It is about preserving untouched beauty of a moist evergreen forest and its rich biodiversity. The now-famous Silent Valley was saved by a remarkable movement led by common people who were not even residing in the vicinity of the forest. The battle against the proposal of a hydroelectric dam across the Kunthipuzha river persisted for 10 years. At that time, people used all possible available means, such as widespread awareness programmes, letters to editors, articles in, newspapers, seminars, and petitions and appeals in court. The movement was successful in saving the Silent Valley.

## 2.3  Plants and Animals in Different Surroundings

You might have observed during nature walks that different animals live in different surroundings. You have also recorded movement of animals in Table 2.5. Does the movement of these animals depend upon their surroundings? Let us consider fishes and goat as examples. Fishes live in water. They have streamlined bodies and fins for movement in water (Fig. 2.8a). Goats live in grassy areas and move with the help of legs (Fig. 2.8b). The sizes and shapes of animals also differ from one another. <!-- text, from page 14 (l=0.114,t=0.402,r=0.747,b=0.647), with ID 836f8194-5a90-41bf-8a97-eae02aa2ba01 -->

There is very little water available in the deserts. A hot desert is typically very hot during the day and very cold at night. Therefore, you will find plants and animals in these areas that can tolerate and survive both the hot conditions during the day and cold conditions at night. The fleshy stems of plants found in the desert can store water and help them tolerate the hot conditions in these places. <!-- text, from page 16 (l=0.118,t=0.127,r=0.745,b=0.264), with ID ec8665de-1889-4e3a-ab82-a5dd5be56316 -->

The mountains in extremely cold regions experience frequent snowfall. In order to survive in such conditions, some of the trees have the ability to let the snow slide off easily. Conical shape and sloping branches of deodar trees enable them to do so easily. <!-- text, from page 16 (l=0.118,t=0.265,r=0.745,b=0.362), with ID ef28e031-c651-4917-abeb-e30a4ccc4d67 -->

You must have understood by now that the biodiversity varies from region to region because of diverse conditions.
    Look at the images of a camel from the hot desert of Rajasthan (Fig. 2.11) and a camel from the cold desert of Ladakh (Fig. 2.12). What are the differences you observe between them? What advantages do these differences provide to these camels? <!-- text, from page 16 (l=0.117,t=0.362,r=0.746,b=0.502), with ID f1099664-c3a7-4409-ba87-b7c2b92c5c94 -->

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The left image shows a single camel standing on sandy terrain under a clear sky, labeled as "A camel living in the hot desert of Rajasthan."
  • The right image shows a single camel standing on snow-covered ground, labeled as "A camel living in the cold desert of Ladakh."
  • Both camels are in profile view, facing right, with their hooves specifically annotated by arrows and the label "Hooves."
  • Lighting is natural daylight; the Rajasthan camel is in a warm, arid setting, while the Ladakh camel is in a cold, snowy environment.

Technical Details :
  • No scale bars or magnification are present.
  • On-image text includes figure numbers (2.11 and 2.12), descriptive captions, and arrows pointing to the camels' hooves.

Spatial Relationships :
  • Each camel occupies the foreground, centrally placed in its respective image.
  • The Rajasthan camel appears leaner with shorter fur, while the Ladakh camel appears bulkier with a thicker, shaggier coat.
  • The background in the Rajasthan image is sandy desert, while the Ladakh image shows snow and possibly mountains.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually contrasts the physical adaptations of camels to hot and cold desert environments, with emphasis on their hooves and differences in body size and fur thickness.
  • The Rajasthan camel is adapted for hot, sandy conditions, while the Ladakh camel is adapted for cold, snowy conditions, as evidenced by their differing coats and body builds. <!-- figure, from page 16 (l=0.130,t=0.508,r=0.784,b=0.742), with ID 8d4f1b81-5fe7-4cd4-bd12-36dd7267c587 -->

The camel of the hot desert has long legs with wide hooves. Alex shares that his grandmother told him that the long legs and wide hooves help these camels to walk on the sandy desert without sinking into the sand. On the other hand, the height and legs of camels of a cold desert are comparatively shorter than those found in a hot desert. These short legs allow them to walk easily in mountainous regions. <!-- text, from page 16 (l=0.116,t=0.757,r=0.747,b=0.901), with ID 9882c929-8c88-44bd-9b69-8fc5afeeb676 -->

In deserts, food is not available easily. Camels store food in their humps. Camels found in the hot desert have one hump each that helps them to survive during the scarcity of food. Camels found in the cold desert have two humps each. These two humps shrink in late winters because there is not much food available in the cold desert and they have to use food stored in their humps during that time. Moreover, they grow long hair from head to neck, which help them survive the cold winters of Ladakh. <!-- text, from page 17 (l=0.254,t=0.084,r=0.884,b=0.263), with ID db7e6a07-faab-4b7d-bafd-1b8f8d17f4f0 -->

Other students also start sharing their observations. Kashi from Rajasthan says that camels excrete small amounts of urine, their dung is dry, and they do not sweat. As camels do not lose much water from their bodies, they can survive for many days without drinking water. <!-- text, from page 17 (l=0.257,t=0.304,r=0.880,b=0.401), with ID 98be6810-a9ac-4ddd-a212-0737dec8439d -->

Maya talks about seeing plants with beautiful bright flowers, **rhododendrons**, in the Shola forests of Nilgiris. Here, rhododendrons are of shorter height and have smaller leaves to survive through the heavy winds on mountain tops. However, Pema, who is from Sikkim, mentions that she has observed rhododendrons in the nearby mountains to be taller (Fig. 2.13). So, even plants such as rhododendrons may exhibit different features in different regions to survive the conditions of those regions. <!-- text, from page 17 (l=0.256,t=0.401,r=0.880,b=0.579), with ID ed3498c6-5545-49ca-b714-e6398eebd14e -->

We have learnt that the plants and animals living in a particular region have special features that make them fit to survive there. The special features that enable plants and animals to survive in a particular region are called **adaptations**. <!-- text, from page 18 (l=0.117,t=0.086,r=0.745,b=0.186), with ID aeed2910-83b9-4fcd-93f9-e78f8d00ddfb -->

The shape of the deodar tree and the height of the rhododendron are adaptations that enable them to survive in the mountainous regions. <!-- text, from page 18 (l=0.118,t=0.186,r=0.744,b=0.245), with ID 55edce13-795a-437c-9615-bc30504ddd64 -->

The place where plants and animals live is called their **habitat**. For example, the habitat of sea turtles is the sea or the ocean. The habitat of a camel is the hot or the cold desert, and the habitat of a rhododendron is the mountains. The habitat of plants and animals provides them food, water, air, shelter and other needs for their survival. Many types of plants and animals may share the same habitat. Habitat plays an important role in shaping the biodiversity of a region. <!-- text, from page 18 (l=0.117,t=0.245,r=0.745,b=0.423), with ID 5c41b587-e01f-4b52-913c-83cba5564b71 -->

Know a scientist

Salim Ali (1896–1987) travelled across India to observe diversity in birds. He prepared a list of birds and documented their travel routes and habitats. He recorded the regions with high diversity of birds and took measures to conserve these regions. Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, Rajasthan and Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary in Mandya, Karnataka are examples of regions he preserved. He wrote a landmark series of 10 books on birds of the Indian Subcontinent. He is referred to as the ‘Birdman of India’. He was awarded Padma Vibhushan in 1976. <!-- text, from page 18 (l=0.110,t=0.429,r=0.834,b=0.744), with ID d906fc98-ae7a-446a-b6e2-8b644b9703b2 -->

What are the different ways in which you can group plants and animals based on their habitats? One way is to group them into those ‘that live on land’ and those ‘that live in water’. <!-- text, from page 18 (l=0.117,t=0.753,r=0.743,b=0.834), with ID b45460f8-6900-4fe1-83bb-ab388240fffb -->

The plants and animals that live on land are said to live in **terrestrial** habitats. Some examples of terrestrial habitats are forests, deserts, grasslands, and mountains. <!-- text, from page 18 (l=0.118,t=0.834,r=0.744,b=0.895), with ID 398b2e4b-16a2-4e23-b269-ced8a9c2e130 -->

The plants and animals that live in water are said to live in aquatic habitats. Some examples of aquatic habitats are ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans.

Some animals, such as frogs, can live in water as well as on land. These are called amphibians.

What would happen if the habitat of a plant or an animal is damaged? What would happen if a goat does not get grass to eat? Can a fish survive without water?

Check with your parents, grandparents, and neighbours to know about the plants, birds, insects or any other animal they used to see frequently in their childhood but do not see as often now. These changes often happen when habitats are damaged. The damage to habitats of plants and animals results in loss of their homes, food, and other resources. This leads to the loss of biodiversity. <!-- text, from page 19 (l=0.250,t=0.083,r=0.888,b=0.386), with ID fb2146ba-9a36-4275-8bca-256bbfccc22e -->

Summary : This flowchart shows a decision-making process for classifying a plant based on the presence of leaves and the type of leaf venation (reticulate or not).

flowchart:
# Nodes :
  • Plant (rectangle)
  • Does it have leaves? (rectangle)
  • Does it have reticulate venation? (rectangle)
  • A (circle)
  • B (circle)

# Connectors :
  • Arrow from Plant to "Does it have leaves?" labeled "Yes"
  • Arrow from "Does it have leaves?" to "Does it have reticulate venation?" labeled "Yes"
  • Arrow from "Does it have reticulate venation?" to A labeled "Yes"
  • Arrow from "Does it have reticulate venation?" to B labeled "No"

# Layout :
  • Vertically stacked rectangles for the main decision path (Plant → Leaves → Venation).
  • Branches at the "Does it have reticulate venation?" node: "Yes" continues downward, "No" branches right.
  • Terminal nodes A and B are circles.

# Analysis :
  • The flowchart provides a simple binary classification system for plants based on leaf presence and venation type. If a plant has leaves with reticulate venation, it is classified as A; if not, as B. The process is linear with a single decision branch at the venation step. <!-- figure, from page 23 (l=0.251,t=0.485,r=0.883,b=0.838), with ID ff217bfc-f89c-4f01-8392-02ac10ae04e7 -->
