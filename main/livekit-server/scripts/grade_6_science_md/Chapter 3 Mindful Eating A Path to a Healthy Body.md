What are your findings from the interviews you conducted? Cooking practices, also called **culinary practices**, have changed over time. There is a significant difference between traditional and modern culinary practices. Earlier, most cooking was done using a *chulha* (Fig. 3.1a). Nowadays, most of us cook using a modern gas stove (Fig. 3.1b). Earlier, most grinding was done manually using a *sil-batta* (Fig. 3.1c). These days, we use an electrical grinder for ease of grinding (Fig. 3.1d). Find out what were the other ways of cooking and grinding. Why have these culinary practices changed over time? These changes may be due to factors such as technological development, improved transportation and better communication. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.113,t=0.082,r=0.753,b=0.355), with ID 70eecf08-d7a0-43b8-990c-6c21228ea4bb -->

Case 1
In earlier times, during long voyages, sailors often suffered from bleeding and swollen gums. During a voyage in 1746, Scottish physician James Lind observed that sailors who consumed lemons and oranges recovered from these symptoms. Bleeding and swollen gums are symptoms of a disease called **scurvy**. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.252,t=0.372,r=0.868,b=0.529), with ID 8f9cece9-2cff-401a-9d2a-82fc2fd175f6 -->

What do you interpret by reading Case 1? What cures scurvy? Lemons and oranges help in curing scurvy. Scurvy is caused due to deficiency of Vitamin C. Vitamin C present in citrus fruits like lemons and oranges helps in curing this disease. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.253,t=0.540,r=0.891,b=0.646), with ID 402b34c1-a136-47de-b3fb-3319eb5c91f5 -->

    – "Do we obtain all nutrients from plants and animals?"  
    – "No, Medu. Nutrients like salt can be obtained from seawater or from rocks."  
    – "Also, Vitamin D can be naturally produced by our body upon exposure to sunlight."  
  • The illustration uses soft colours and cartoon-style drawing.

Spatial Relationships :  
  • The children are arranged in a loose semicircle, with speech bubbles connecting their dialogue.  
  • The sun icon is placed near the child discussing Vitamin D and sunlight.

Analysis :  
  • The key visual message is that nutrients can come from sources other than plants and animals, such as rocks, seawater, and sunlight (for Vitamin D production).  
  • The illustration supports a science education context, clarifying misconceptions about nutrient sources. <!-- figure, from page 11 (l=0.165,t=0.397,r=0.890,b=0.736), with ID ad7af1cf-beb8-42f1-92de-671e0f4821ad -->

Fruits and vegetables are rich in dietary fibres. Let us see how dietary fibres are beneficial for us. <!-- text, from page 11 (l=0.252,t=0.736,r=0.888,b=0.779), with ID c4749e3c-ea89-4faa-b284-161987cfcaad -->

In addition to the essential nutrients, our body needs dietary fibres and water. Dietary fibres, also known as **roughage**, do not provide any nutrients to our body. However, they are an essential component of our food. They help our body get rid of undigested food and ensure smooth passage of stools. Roughage in our food is provided mainly by suitable plant products. <!-- text, from page 11 (l=0.254,t=0.779,r=0.889,b=0.904), with ID 4994f60e-24a8-4568-b37a-c69c17af5cb6 -->

Know a scientist

**Coluthur Gopalan** (1918–2019) initiated nutrition research in India. He analysed more than 500 Indian foods for their nutritional value and recommended an appropriate diet in the Indian context. He led surveys on the nutritional status of the Indian population, identifying widespread deficiencies in protein, energy, and other food components. This led to the implementation of the Mid Day Meal Programme in 2002, now a ‘PM POSHAN’ initiative, to provide balanced food in the government-run and government-aided schools of our country. This scheme has played a role in improving the health and nutrition of millions of children nationwide. <!-- text, from page 12 (l=0.109,t=0.477,r=0.744,b=0.900), with ID d8d4add7-3cd1-4329-8f63-7fb373eb2d3e -->

- Activity 3.6: Let us investigate
- ◦ Take a small part of the food items that you tested for the presence of starch in Activity 3.5.
- ◦ Place each food item on a separate piece of paper.
- ◦ Wrap the paper around the food and press it. Be careful not to tear the paper.
- ◦ If a food item contains a little water, allow the paper to dry. <!-- text, from page 14 (l=0.115,t=0.120,r=0.757,b=0.317), with ID fb1e7590-d42b-439d-ad55-f9f7661ab05d -->

Does the paper develop an oily patch? What do you think is the reason for this patch? If oil or butter is present in the food item, it leaves an oily patch on the paper. Now, hold the paper against light. Can you see the light faintly shining through this patch? An oily patch on the paper shows that the food item contains fat. Which of these items contain fats?

illustration:
Scene Overview :
  • Three individuals in lab coats are conducting a protein test experiment at a laboratory table.
  • The table contains labeled items: test tubes, bottles of copper sulphate and caustic soda, a pestle and mortar, and plates with different food samples (bread, rice, peanuts, peas, soya bean).
  • One person is holding a test tube and a dropper, another is holding a notebook and pencil, and the third is handling test tubes.

Technical Details :
  • Bottles labeled "Copper Sulphate" and "Caustic Soda" are present, indicating the use of the Biuret test for protein detection.
  • Food items are clearly labeled: bread, rice, peanuts, peas, soya bean.
  • Pestle and mortar are used for grinding food samples before testing.
  • No scale bar or magnification is present; this is a schematic educational illustration.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The food items are arranged in a row on plates in front of the experimenters, each clearly labeled.
  • The chemical reagents and pestle and mortar are placed to the left, with test tubes in a rack.
  • The individuals are positioned behind the table, centrally and symmetrically.

Analysis :

What did you observe? Did the content of some test tubes turn violet? This violet colour indicates the presence of proteins in the food item. Write your observations in Table 3.3. <!-- text, from page 15 (l=0.253,t=0.617,r=0.892,b=0.701), with ID 929b4e98-bcb9-4ac0-bc84-d20e4484367b -->

What conclusions can you draw from Table 3.3? Which food items show the presence of more than one nutrient? Which food items show the presence of both proteins and fats? Peanuts show the presence of both proteins and fats. This indicates that any food which we eat may contain multiple nutrients. Is there a food item that lacks any of these nutrients? Which of these foods do you consume daily? Try to find out other foods that are good sources of starch, fats, and proteins. <!-- text, from page 15 (l=0.253,t=0.701,r=0.894,b=0.888), with ID a96306da-da98-40ca-9620-07030aae697c -->

Based on the nutritional information on the food packets given above, which food would you choose? Why?

Some foods have high calories due to high sugar and fat content. Moreover, they contain very low amounts of proteins, minerals, vitamins, and dietary fibres. These foods are called junk foods. These foods include potato wafers, candy bars and carbonated drinks. Consuming these foods frequently is not good as these are not healthy for our body. They make a person obese. Such a person may suffer from several health problems. You should always remember Dr Poshita’s statement that ‘Health is the Ultimate Wealth.’ We should take care of our body to stay healthy. Eating a balanced diet and avoiding junk food contribute towards <!-- text, from page 17 (l=0.248,t=0.611,r=0.898,b=0.886), with ID 17ca13fd-9ce6-4911-9f0f-30628548d983 -->

Packaged food items must have information about the nutrients on their cover. The information should list the amount of each nutrient. Sometimes, more nutrients are added to the food during processing (fortification) to improve its nutritional quality. Iodised salt and some baby foods are examples of fortified foods. The Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI) is a government agency that regulates food quality in India.

Millets are small-sized grains and have been an integral part of the Indian diet for centuries. They have regained popularity due to their numerous health benefits. They are good sources of vitamins, minerals like iron and calcium, and dietary fibres as well. That is the reason they are also called nutri-cereals. They contribute significantly to a balanced diet required for the normal functioning of our body. <!-- text, from page 18 (l=0.113,t=0.739,r=0.758,b=0.906), with ID 8a8c82e9-c61a-41b4-8181-f4a4b1eda62a -->

### 3.6  Food Miles: From Farm to Our Plate

How does food reach from a farm to our plate? What are the steps involved in this process? Who are the people involved in this process? Do you know how much time and effort is required to get the wheat flour once seed grains germinate in the farm? Let us look at Fig. 3.10 to understand the entire process of making the chapati that we eat. <!-- text, from page 19 (l=0.252,t=0.083,r=0.892,b=0.252), with ID 9df62224-a29c-4524-b408-fa5e73995bef -->

Summary : This flowchart illustrates the journey of wheat from being grown on a farm to becoming chapati on our plate, detailing each step in the process from cultivation to consumption.

flowchart:
# Nodes :
  • Farmer growing wheat (rectangular image with two sub-images: one of a hand inspecting wheat, another of people working in a field)
  • Threshing and winnowing of grains (rectangular image of a person threshing wheat)
  • Storage of grains (rectangular image of stacked sacks)
  • Grinding of grains and packing (rectangular image of a sack of grain and a grinding/packing machine)
  • Transport to retail shop (rectangular image of a supermarket shelf)
  • Food on our plate (rectangular image of a plate with chapatis)

# Connectors :
  • Arrows connect each node in a clockwise sequence, indicating the process flow: 
    - Farmer growing wheat → Threshing and winnowing of grains → Storage of grains → Grinding of grains and packing → Transport to retail shop → Food on our plate → (cycle completes back to the start).

# Layout :
  • Circular/clockwise arrangement of nodes, starting from the top (farmer) and proceeding through each stage, ending with food on the plate.
  • Each node is accompanied by a descriptive label.
  • Central title: "STORY OF CHAPATI: FROM FARM TO PLATE" and figure label "Fig. 3.10: From farm to plate".

# Analysis :
  • The flowchart visually communicates the sequential steps involved in transforming wheat from its initial cultivation to its final form as chapati ready for consumption.
  • The process is linear and cyclical, emphasizing the interconnectedness of agricultural production, processing, distribution, and consumption.
  • Each stage is clearly depicted with both images and text, making the process easy to follow for educational purposes. <!-- figure, from page 19 (l=0.247,t=0.274,r=0.893,b=0.710), with ID 37323034-808d-412d-9799-e93274fe9b39 -->

The entire distance travelled by a bag of wheat or any other food item, from the producer to the consumer, is known as its **food miles**. Reducing food miles is important because it helps to cut down the cost and pollution during its transport; it helps support local farmers; and it also keeps our food fresh and healthy. <!-- text, from page 19 (l=0.248,t=0.721,r=0.894,b=0.853), with ID d168f5ac-dfd4-4c59-b2c1-11e77269d2cb -->

Many people waste food, leaving it unconsumed on their plates. One must remember the time and effort put by our farmers and other community members in getting the food from the farm to our plate. We must take only as much food as we can consume. It would reduce food wastage. Try to find the timeline for the various processes involved in getting the food from farm to plate (Fig. 3.10).

How would eating local food help reduce food miles? <!-- text, from page 20 (l=0.114,t=0.083,r=0.856,b=0.272), with ID 610703ea-359c-4e35-94c9-8d16e41e7efb -->
