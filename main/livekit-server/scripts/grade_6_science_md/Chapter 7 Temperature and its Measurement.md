7.2  Temperature

A reliable measure of hotness (or coldness) of a body is its **temperature.** A hotter body has a higher temperature than a colder body. The difference in temperature between the two bodies tells us how hot a body is in comparison to another body. A device that measures temperature is called a **thermometer.**

There are two kinds of thermometers that you are likely to come across—clinical thermometers and laboratory thermometers. Clinical thermometers are used to measure human body temperatures whereas laboratory thermometers are used for many other purposes. Let us now learn more about thermometers and how to use them to measure temperature. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.115,t=0.270,r=0.747,b=0.574), with ID 0e69cacc-a721-40b2-a953-0079831cddcb -->

be 37.0 °C. What we call normal temperature is the average body temperature of a large number of healthy people. A perfectly healthy person may, therefore, have a normal temperature slightly different from 37.0 °C. The body temperature is influenced by several factors, such as age, time of the day and activity level. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.411,t=0.198,r=0.884,b=0.359), with ID 9d598c82-00e6-4994-9044-372ba60a5871 -->

You may try measuring your own temperature at different times of the day and on different days. Record the thermometer readings in your notebook. After a month, analyse your temperature record and see if there are any variations. If yes, try to think what might be the reasons for that. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.412,t=0.360,r=0.886,b=0.501), with ID 3abb4611-0f27-4bac-af96-beab5e769aee -->

The temperature of human beings does not normally go below 35 °C or above 42 °C.
For measuring the body temperature of small children or old people, the digital thermometer can also be placed in the armpit. The temperature measured this way is about 0.5 °C to 1 °C lower than the actual body temperature. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.413,t=0.501,r=0.886,b=0.663), with ID ad515fd7-150a-4d34-a5e9-7ae214e6db86 -->

There is another scale of temperature known as **Fahrenheit scale**. On this scale, the unit of temperature is **degree Fahrenheit** and is denoted by °F. A temperature measured as 37.0 °C on Celsius scale is equivalent to 98.6 °F on Fahrenheit scale. The Fahrenheit scale is not used in most scientific studies anymore. In scientific work, there is another scale of temperature known as **Kelvin scale**. On this scale, the unit for temperature is **kelvin** and is denoted by **K**. The **SI unit of temperature** is kelvin. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.411,t=0.664,r=0.887,b=0.909), with ID 6a739715-ebb1-49aa-a77a-b61e0312c99a -->

The names of temperature scales—Celsius scale,
Fahrenheit scale and Kelvin scale—start with a capital
letter. For the units for temperature, degree Celsius and degree
Fahrenheit, the word degree starts with a lower-case letter while
Celsius and Fahrenheit start with a capital letter. The unit kelvin
starts with a lower-case letter. The symbols of all units (°C, °F, K) are
capital letters. Note that degree sign (°) is not written with K. A full
stop is not written after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence.
While writing the temperature, a space is left between the number
and the unit. For temperatures more than one degree, use the plural
of ‘degree’, that is, ‘degrees’, while writing the full form of the unit. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.117,t=0.259,r=0.789,b=0.503), with ID f90ffcf4-038d-4bba-bdfa-f18f55bb3b29 -->

Do you know?

How was fever detected before thermometers were developed? Fever affects the pulse rate of a person. This was known even in olden days in India. However, apart from fever, some other situations also affect the pulse rate. Hence, pulse rate alone is not a reliable indicator of fever. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.374,t=0.530,r=0.848,b=0.756), with ID b90d235c-0cb6-47de-a6ee-0996b23ead98 -->

Activity 7.4: Let us observe and calculate

Let us now try to find the smallest value that a given laboratory thermometer can read.
◆ Again, take the same laboratory thermometer which you used in Activity 7.3 and observe it carefully.
◆ Note down the following:
— How much is the temperature difference indicated between the two bigger marks? --------------------------
— How many divisions (shown by smaller marks) are there between these two bigger marks?
-----------------------------------------------
— How much temperature does one small division indicate? -----------------------------------------------
— So, the smallest value that the thermometer can read is ----------------------------------------------- <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.115,t=0.094,r=0.752,b=0.449), with ID 9308ba5e-de6b-4900-b1b1-6fe3579dd87e -->

Fig. 7.3(b):
Closeup of a part of the thermometer

For the thermometer shown in Fig. 7.3b, the temperature difference indicated between 0 °C and 10 °C or between 10 °C and 20 °C is 10 °C. And the number of divisions between these marks are 10 divisions. So, one small division can read 10/10 = 1 °C.

That is, the smallest value that this thermometer can read is 1 °C.

Your school laboratory may have thermometers for which the range and the value of the smallest division may be different. It is, therefore, always necessary to look carefully at the thermometer you are about to use.

Summary : This figure demonstrates the correct procedure for measuring the temperature of warm water using a laboratory thermometer, including the proper positioning of the thermometer and the correct method for reading the temperature.

photo:
Scene Overview :
  • The main subject is a hand holding a laboratory thermometer vertically in a beaker containing warm water.
  • The thermometer's bulb is immersed in the water but does not touch the bottom or sides of the beaker.
  • A closeup illustration shows the scale of the thermometer and an eye positioned at the level of the liquid column for accurate reading.
  • The setting is a simple laboratory environment with neutral lighting and a clear background.

Technical Details :
  • The thermometer is marked with a scale, with visible numbers (e.g., 40, 50, 60).
  • The beaker is transparent, allowing clear visibility of the water and thermometer bulb.
  • The closeup highlights the importance of reading the thermometer at eye level.
  • Labels identify the laboratory thermometer, beaker, and warm water.

Spatial Relationships :
  • The thermometer is held vertically, not tilted, ensuring accurate measurement.
  • The bulb is suspended in the water, away from the beaker's sides and bottom.
  • The eye is shown directly in line with the liquid column in the thermometer for proper reading.

Analysis :
  • The figure visually reinforces key steps for accurate temperature measurement: vertical positioning of the thermometer, avoiding contact with the beaker, reading while immersed, and aligning the eye with the liquid column. These practices help prevent parallax error and ensure reliable readings in laboratory settings. <!-- figure, from page 9 (l=0.113,t=0.090,r=0.897,b=0.510), with ID c936088a-a765-40a4-912b-651bd3d27877 -->

- ◆ Take some warm water in a beaker.
- ◆ Dip the thermometer in water so that the bulb is immersed in water (Fig. 7.4).
- ◆ Observe the rise of liquid column in the thermometer. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.251,t=0.517,r=0.987,b=0.650), with ID 83121005-41d6-4d53-97fc-62e41e811378 -->

Wait till the column stops rising and note the temperature (do not wait too long; otherwise, the water itself will start to cool).

    What is the temperature of water measured by you? Compare it with the readings of your friends.
    Do you notice that, as soon as you take the thermometer out of the water, the level of liquid column begins to fall?
    This means that the temperature must be read while the thermometer is immersed in water. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.349,t=0.652,r=0.891,b=0.881), with ID fe0b2af4-9b4e-4677-b3b3-9d688e7e93df -->

  • Thermometer (b): Scale marked in increments of 0.5°C, with longer lines at every 5°C.  
  • Thermometer (c): Scale marked in increments of 2°C, with longer lines at every 10°C.

Spatial Relationships :  
  • All thermometers are shown upright and side-by-side for direct comparison.  
  • The bulbs and liquid columns are visible, but the liquid level is at the bottom (not indicating any temperature).

Analysis :  
  • Thermometer (b) is the most suitable for measuring 22.5°C because its scale allows readings to the nearest 0.5°C, matching the required precision.  
  • Thermometer (a) only allows readings to the nearest 1°C, and thermometer (c) to the nearest 2°C, making them less precise for 22.5°C. <!-- figure, from page 16 (l=0.119,t=0.478,r=0.749,b=0.902), with ID 295c1bf8-5955-4901-b88c-e895de04a03e -->

- Gather information from the Internet and find out how the body temperature of animals, such as a cat, dog, horse, camel, cow and buffalo, is measured. If there is any veterinary hospital in your vicinity, you may visit to see the body temperature of animals being measured.
- Find out which places in India are usually regarded to be the coldest and hottest. Also, find out the minimum and the maximum temperatures recorded for these places.
- Various planets in our Solar System are at different distances from the Sun. Search the Internet and make a table with the planets, their distances from the Sun (in increasing order) and their temperatures written. Does the average temperature of planets decrease as their distance from the Sun increases? If it is not true for any planet, find out for which planet and why.
- Hang a room thermometer in your classroom. Set up the apparatus, as shown in Fig. 7.11, near the thermometer hung on the wall.

  Take the readings of thermometers 1 and 2 three times during the day, say, first period, lunch break, and last period. <!-- text, from page 17 (l=0.253,t=0.393,r=0.894,b=0.898), with ID e568405b-7e81-47e7-9557-2c32ca478e3d -->

Summary : This illustration shows an experimental setup for measuring and comparing the temperature of water in a beaker and the ambient room temperature using two different thermometers.

photo:  
Scene Overview :  
  • The main subjects are a laboratory stand holding a beaker of water and a laboratory thermometer, and a separate room thermometer mounted on the wall.  
  • The setting is a laboratory environment, with the apparatus placed on a wooden table against a blue background.  
  • The composition is side-on, showing all equipment clearly labeled.

Technical Details :  
  • Laboratory thermometer (Thermometer 2) is clamped vertically so its bulb is immersed in the water inside the beaker.  
  • Room thermometer (Thermometer 1) is mounted on the wall, not in contact with the beaker or water.  
  • The beaker is filled with water and placed on the table.  
  • No scale bars or magnification are present; all items are shown at realistic size.  
  • Labels identify each component: Thermometer 1 (Room thermometer), Thermometer 2 (Laboratory thermometer), Beaker, Water.

Spatial Relationships :  
  • The laboratory thermometer is positioned so its bulb is submerged in the water, ensuring accurate measurement of water temperature.  
  • The room thermometer is placed away from the beaker, measuring ambient air temperature.  
  • The beaker is centrally located on the table, with the stand and clamp to its left.

Analysis :  
  • The setup allows for simultaneous measurement of water temperature and room temperature, enabling comparison over time.  
  • The illustration supports an experiment to observe temperature changes and draw conclusions about thermal equilibrium or environmental effects.  
  • The clear separation of the two thermometers ensures independent readings for water and air. <!-- figure, from page 18 (l=0.135,t=0.091,r=0.737,b=0.534), with ID 876c361a-1b76-4df4-b578-3db2034b264e -->

More to know!

The temperature at the core of the Sun reaches as high as 15 million degrees Celsius. Are there objects in the sky that have even higher temperatures? There is no limit on the highest temperature that can exist. However, as per scientific understanding, there is a limit to the lowest temperature that can be achieved. It is close to –273.15 °C (0 kelvin) and is called absolute zero. <!-- text, from page 18 (l=0.093,t=0.566,r=0.776,b=0.813), with ID 6c2e039b-203e-486f-90d4-5c8511608d0f -->
