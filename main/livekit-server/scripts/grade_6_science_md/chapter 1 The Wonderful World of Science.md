Even though you may have not realised,
you have already been finding answers to
many of your questions. Suppose your pen stops
writing. What would you do? You would ask yourself the
question, “Why did my pen stop writing?” You might guess
that the ink finished. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.115,t=0.312,r=0.751,b=0.433), with ID 81af4374-5f04-4340-bc80-a6e7755f88bc -->

First, we observe something that we find interesting or we do not understand.

This makes us wonder and perhaps think of a question about it.

Then, we guess a possible answer to that question.

We test this guess through experiments or more observations.

We then try to analyse the results to see if it actually answers our question. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.259,t=0.083,r=0.883,b=0.359), with ID 88aa0515-bcfc-49a0-963a-3da333f0a6c1 -->
