# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for educational content suffers from poor quality data extraction from PDF textbooks. The system ingests page numbers, image descriptions, improperly formatted table data, and other noise that degrades the AI agent's ability to answer student questions accurately. This feature will implement advanced document processing techniques, intelligent content filtering, and multi-modal extraction methods to create a high-quality knowledge base specifically optimized for educational Q&A scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI agent answering student questions, I want access to clean, well-structured educational content, so that I can provide accurate and relevant answers without noise from page numbers, headers, or formatting artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing PDF textbooks THEN the system SHALL remove page numbers, headers, footers, and navigation elements
2. WHEN extracting text content THEN the system SHALL filter out non-educational metadata with 95% accuracy
3. WHEN encountering formatting artifacts THEN the system SHALL clean or remove them without losing educational content
4. WHEN processing multi-column layouts THEN the system SHALL preserve reading order and logical flow
5. IF content contains less than 20 meaningful words THEN the system SHALL exclude it from the knowledge base

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an educational content processor, I want to extract and structure tables, diagrams, and mathematical formulas properly, so that students can get complete answers about data, visual concepts, and mathematical relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering tables in PDFs THEN the system SHALL extract structured data with column headers and relationships preserved
2. WHEN processing mathematical formulas THEN the system SHALL convert them to LaTeX format for proper rendering
3. WHEN finding diagrams or images THEN the system SHALL generate descriptive text that explains the visual concept
4. WHEN extracting charts or graphs THEN the system SHALL describe the data relationships and key insights
5. IF a table spans multiple pages THEN the system SHALL reconstruct it as a complete entity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content quality manager, I want the system to use multiple extraction methods and validate content quality, so that only high-quality educational material enters the knowledge base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL use at least 3 different extraction methods (PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, Unstructured)
2. WHEN extraction methods disagree THEN the system SHALL use ensemble voting to select the best result
3. WHEN content quality is below threshold THEN the system SHALL flag it for manual review or exclusion
4. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL provide quality metrics and confidence scores
5. IF extraction confidence is below 70% THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative processing methods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an educational AI system, I want content to be chunked semantically by topics and concepts rather than arbitrary length, so that retrieval returns complete, contextually relevant information for student questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating content chunks THEN the system SHALL use semantic boundaries (topics, concepts, examples) rather than fixed character limits
2. WHEN a concept spans multiple paragraphs THEN the system SHALL keep related content together in the same chunk
3. WHEN processing exercises or examples THEN the system SHALL create dedicated chunks with proper context
4. WHEN encountering definitions THEN the system SHALL create focused chunks that include the term, definition, and relevant examples
5. IF a chunk exceeds optimal size THEN the system SHALL split at natural semantic boundaries while preserving context

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student asking questions, I want the AI to access content with rich metadata and relationships, so that I receive comprehensive answers that connect concepts across chapters and subjects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing content THEN the system SHALL extract and tag educational metadata (difficulty level, prerequisites, learning objectives)
2. WHEN creating chunks THEN the system SHALL identify cross-references and relationships to other topics
3. WHEN storing content THEN the system SHALL include hierarchical topic classification (subject > chapter > section > concept)
4. WHEN processing examples THEN the system SHALL link them to their parent concepts and related problems
5. IF content references other chapters or concepts THEN the system SHALL create explicit relationship mappings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive quality monitoring and validation tools, so that I can ensure the RAG system maintains high accuracy and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL generate detailed quality reports with metrics and sample extractions
2. WHEN quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for improvement
3. WHEN content is updated THEN the system SHALL track version changes and quality evolution over time
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and system improvement
5. IF quality degrades below acceptable thresholds THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest corrective actions
